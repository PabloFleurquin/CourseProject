# Explanation on naming convention used for the variables
=========================================================================

1. The features.txt has been used to read the variables name.
2. For each var name in this file some character expressions has been eliminated using gsub function:
	- Parenthesis
	- Underscore
	- Dash
	- Comma
3. All variables name are in lower-case (I couldn't do week 4, that apparently from the discussion board is where the variable name explanation is)
